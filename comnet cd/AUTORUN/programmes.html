                            <h3>Wide Area Aerial Surveillance for Situation Awareness and Security Automation</h3>
                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">ABSTRACT</p>
                            <p class="just">
                                <br>Wide area surveillance refers to an automated monitoring process that involves data acquisition, analysis, and interpretation for understanding object behaviors. Automated surveillance systems are mostly used for military, law enforcement, and commercial applications. Intelligent visual surveillance is also becoming more popular in applications such as human identification, activity recognition, behavior analysis, anomaly detection, alarming, etc. The rapidly growing field of wide area surveillance involves data acquisition and processing of video captured from long range and wide viewing angle sensors. Aircrafts, many times unmanned, flying at very high altitude capture high resolution data of the ground below. Today’s camera technology can capture frames with Giga-pixel resolution at a rate of 60 frames per second. As camera capabilities continue to improve, higher resolution data will be captured at faster rates. The data is captured from high altitudes and therefore that may cover hundreds of square miles within its field of view.
                                <br>
                                <br>Detection, tracking, and identification of moving objects in a wide area surveillance environment have been an active research area in the past few decades. Object motion analysis and interpretation are integral components for activity monitoring and situational awareness. Real- time performance of these data analysis tasks in a very wide field of view is an important need for monitoring in security and law enforcement applications. Although huge strides have been made in the field of computer vision related to technology development for automatic monitoring systems, there is a need for robust algorithms that can perform detections of objects and individuals in a surveillance environment. This is mainly because of certain constraints such as partial occlusions of the body, heavily crowded scenes where objects are very close to each other, etc. We present a robust automated system which can detect and identify people by automated face recognition in a surveillance environment and track their actions and activities by a spatio-temporal feature tracking mechanism.
                                <br>
                                <br>Research in autonomous detection of machinery threats on oil and gas pipeline right-of- ways (ROWs) in wide area imagery is an important task to protect our pipeline infrastructure. A great amount of effort is required for human analysts to identify threats manually in thousands of images captured by small aircrafts or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Therefore, there is a need for a full-fledged intrusion detection system to automate this process. In order to provide robust monitoring of threats or intrusions to pipeline ROWs, the technology should be capable of addressing the challenges due to image resolution, sensor noise, lighting conditions, partial occlusions, and various heights and viewing angles between the objects and sensors. We present an automatic object detection system that can detect potential threat objects on pipeline ROWs to aid the human analysts for threat evaluation and subsequent actions. Our real-time automated airborne monitoring system can detect, recognize, and locate machinery threats such as construction equipment entering the pipeline ROWs.</p>

Network Architecture has evolved from hierarchical to flat IP architecture. Cloud Computing model has inspired similar architectures of NFV and SDN in telecom network. NFV decouples software implementations of Network Functions from the compute, storage, and networking resources through a virtualisation layer.

With increasing data usage, the 3GPP has now standardized the access of unlicensed spectrum by using enhancements to existing LTE technology. LTE in the unlicensed band currently has various flavors: LAA (License Assisted Access), LTE-U (LTE-Unlicensed), LWA (LTE Wi-Fi Aggregation) &amp; LWIP (LTE WLAN Aggregation with IPSec Tunnel). In this talk, we delve in to the relative merits and challenges of each of these new access mechanisms and its relevance with regard to the upcoming millimeter wave based 5G transmission techniques.</p>
